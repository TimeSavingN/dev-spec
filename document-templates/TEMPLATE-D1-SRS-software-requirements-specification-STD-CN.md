## 2. Overall Description 

This section will give an overview of the whole system. The system will be explained in its context to show how the system interacts with other systems and introduce the basic functionality of it. It will also describe what type of stakeholders that will use the system and what functionality is available for each type. At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented.

### 2.1 Product Perspective

> - To describe your project is what looks like. Its parts, its functionality and requirements.
> - Business Process Diagrams
> - Business Interactive Diagrams

### 2.2 Product Functions

> - To describe product provides functionality.
> - Functionality Mindmap.
> - ER model Diagram.
> - Flow Diagrams.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

> Types of users to interact with the system.
>
> For example: There are three types of users that interact with the system: ...

### 2.4 Constraints (or Limitations)

> System constraints.
>
> For example: The mobile application is constrained by the system interface to the GPS navigation system within the mobile phone

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies

> For example: One assumption about the product is that it will always be used on mobile phones that have enough performance.

## 3\. Requirements

This section contains all of the functional and quality requirements of the system. It gives a detailed description of the system and all its features.

### 3.1 External interfaces
